Idea: Create a network scanner that will scan an IP address, or IP/CIDR, and any open ports for services running, list services running on said ports with version number and whether it is TCP/UDP service. The main application that already achieves this is nmap. I'd like to attempt to make a clone of this to gain further understanding into how the application works and networking/security in general.

User Personas: This would mainly be aimed at sysadmins/pentesters and general users interested in security and networking.

User Stories: The user would enter an IP address, or IP/CIDR, and desired ports to be scanned, or none to scan all known ports. The scan would come back with a list of services running on currently open ports with version numbers of the software. The user could then use the software and version number to search exploitdb for known exploits.

Technologies Used:
Python
React
Flask
SQLite3

Devlopment/Deployment:
If I had unlimited time I'd like to be able to add a scripting engine, multi threading, multiple export formats instead of just a simple react based front end.
